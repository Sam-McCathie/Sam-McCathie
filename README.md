#### Hey! I'm Sam.

I am a junior software developer currently living in Auckland, New Zealand.

I have recently changed from a career in Real Estate as a Personal Assistant -> Operations Manager -> Systems Analyst to pursue my long-term goal of getting into the tech industry.

I have been studying full stack web development through Mission Ready HQ's tech career accelorator programs, along with many other full stack orientated online courses.
